# calabash-frontend

Bash and .bat scripts, frequently used extensions, XML catalog for XML Calabash.

You can check out the whole thing using

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/transpect/calabash-frontend calabash
```

transpect projects usually have their Calabash runtime attached as a submodule or as an svn external. It typically resides in a subdirectory `calabash` of the project. If the project directory is `${pdu}` (in oXygen notation), the Calabash frontend will use an XML catalog `${pdu}/xmlcatalog/catalog.xml` by default. This contains `<nextCatalog>` instructions that read the catalogs of the transpect libraries that the project uses. Catalog resolution is important since the XProc, XSLT, font, â€¦ files within the modules will only be addressed by their canonical locations (typically starting with `http//transpect.io`). 

Attaching this and its submodules as a submodule to a git repo works like this:

```
git submodule add  git@github.com:transpect/calabash-frontend.git calabash --recursive
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

If you are using this from an svn-based project, you need to incorporate no less than 5 externals. This is partly because Calabash now is modularized but mainly because we cannot stick `svn:externals` properties to github projects.

The externals are:

```
https://github.com/transpect/calabash-frontend/trunk calabash
https://github.com/transpect/calabash-distro/trunk calabash/distro
https://github.com/transpect/unzip-extension/trunk calabash/extensions/transpect/unzip-extension
https://github.com/transpect/rng-extension/trunk calabash/extensions/transpect/rng-extension
https://github.com/transpect/image-props-extension/trunk calabash/extensions/transpect/image-props-extension
```

You can add more externals under `calabash/extensions` if you need other Calabash extensions, or just put them anywhere you like. In each case, make sure to add the corresponding classpaths to the CLASSPATH environment variable (currently for the `calabash/calabash.sh` invocation only). If the extensions use the new Calabash 1.1 annotation/introspection mechanism, they should be instantly available.

There is a `calabash/calabash.bat` invocation for Windows. Users of Linux, MacOS X or Cygwin should use `calabash/calabash.sh`. Apart from the `$CLASSPATH`, the latter accepts `DEBUG` and `HEAP` as environment variables. Example:

```
HEAP=512m DEBUG=yes calabash/calabash.sh calabash/extensions/transpect/image-props-extension/image-identify-example.xpl
```

Please look at the comments in calabash.sh for a relatively easy, externals-based way to enable commercial versions of Saxon. You need to have a suitable Saxon license file though.
