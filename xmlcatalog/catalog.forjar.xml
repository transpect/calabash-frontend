  <!-- Catalog of the importing project. Must come next-to-last, before the catalog that nils http://transpect.io
  as a fallback, that is, it maps http://transpect.io to a non-existent local URI.
  A similar nextCatalog entry should be present as the last entry in this imported project catalog. 
  The reason is that the XSLT-based catalog resolver defaults to reading the project’s catalog. 
  This is because libraries that use the XSLT-based catalog resolver shouldn’t import a catalog that is specific 
  to an XProc processor, like the one that is imported last from this Calabash-specific catalog. 
  A default catalog is available at https://github.com/transpect/xslt-util/blob/master/xmlcatalog/transpect.io.catalog.xml. 
  If you use xslt-util as a submodule or external below the project’s main directory, you can import this catalog with
  <nextCatalog catalog="../xslt-util/xmlcatalog/transpect.io.catalog.xml"/>
  from your project’s catalog. -->
